CiviCRM support for Aegir
=======================

This Drush module will update the CiviCRM configuration file and database
when migrating sites.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Drop this directory in Aegir's Drush path (e.g. /var/aegir/.drush).

It should just do its thing when a CiviCRM-enabled site is migrated.

Caveats
-------

No code yet, it doesn't do anything.
